This tool provides an OpenStreetMap data parser to turn them into csv files made for routing.

== FILE FORMAT ==
Given an .osm XML file, it generates two csv files with a coma as separator

* nodes.csv that contains
    * id (64 bit integer)
    * longitude (decimal real)
    * latitude (decimal real)
    * altitude (integer in meters)

* edges.csv that contains
    * id (64 bit integer)
    * source node id (64 bit integer)
    * target node id (64 bit integer)
    * length (real in meters),
    * car accessibility (integer)
    * car reverse accessibility (integer)
    * bike accessibility (integer)
    * bike reverse accessibility (integer)
    * foot accessibility (integer)
    * geometry (string representing a linestring in the WKT format)

The accessibility is an integer describing the edge for every mean of transport.
As for cars an bikes the driving direction might change those properties, the
are direct (source->target direction) an reverse (target->source direction)
information.

The integers mean:
* cars (the speed is an indication of average speed in kilometers per hour,
  however it is not meant for a precise routing)
    * 0 forbiden
    * 1 residential street (20)
    * 2 tertiary road (30)
    * 3 secondary road (50)
    * 4 primary road (90)
    * 5 trunk (100)
    * 6 motorway (120)
* bike
    * 0 forbiden
    * 1 cycling lane in the opposite direction of the car flow
    * 2 allowed without specific equipment
    * 3 cycling lane
    * 4 bus lane allowed for cycles
    * 5 cycling track

== INSTALL ==
You need the GCC C++ complier (g++), the expat library and python.

Run make and it should compile.

== USAGE == 
Get the .osm XML file of the region that interests you.
For limited regions, use the export tools from the web interface.
For bigger regions you might find what you want at http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/

You need an internet connection in order to get elevation data from
http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/ (done automatically).

Just run
./run_me.py your_file.osm

It should generate the edges.csv and nodes.csv files
